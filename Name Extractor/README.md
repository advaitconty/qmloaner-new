# Names Extractor
These are the names for the current SPSGE batch, extracted from the Excel spreadsheet (also attached). 
The current MongoDB database does allow for more expandability, including an attendance system, but to stick to be able to finish within 1 month, we have not done so.

## Running it
1. Copy all names from the Excel Spreedsheet into ``names.txt``
2. Run the Python script
3. The result will be a list, which can be easily pasted into ``secrets.py``
